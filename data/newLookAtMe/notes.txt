updated version of the LookAtMe_old files
added 2 columns: 'morphing level' , 'gender'

'gender' -> 0 if the image in picName represent a man
'gender' -> 1 if the image in picName represent a woman

'morphing level' -> value from 1 to 6
1 : cs-
2 : gs1
3 : gs2
4 : gs3
5 : gs4
6 : cs+

note: the morphing level is not related to the subject.
In the experiment some subject receives the shock at cs-, others at cs+
In this file we have associated the shock always to cs+, never to cs-
